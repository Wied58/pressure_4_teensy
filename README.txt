The origin for this sketch came from the Parallax Webpage for the device as a sketch for an Arduino. The results were suspect, so I worked out the math long hand from the Intersema data sheet and remote parts of the code. 

It was tested the Adler Planetarium's vacuum chambers, and flown several times on the Far Horizons High Altitude balloon program.
